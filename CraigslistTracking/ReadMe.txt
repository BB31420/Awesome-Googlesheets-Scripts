Make a new Google Spreadsheet

Import the three scripts to your app extensions for the sheet

While having the initial sheet, run the first script GetCraigslistLocalities

Then run the GetCraigslistCatogories 

You should have two sheets now. Use the info on these sheets to customize the third script GetCraigslistItems to you desired query

By running additional searches you will build a spreadsheet tracking your desired items
